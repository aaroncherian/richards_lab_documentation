    - [ ] Where to place them
    - [ ] General procedural troubleshooting like markers falling off and whatnot

    - [ ] Which cameras you use for which setup (treadmill vs. overground etc.)
- [ ] How to record Qualisys data 
- [ ] How to operate the force plates (overground and treadmill)

### NIH Toolbox 
- [x] Figuring out how to handle NIH ToolBox subscription (currently on Michael's iPad)

### Data Analysis
- [ ] Learn Qualisys -> OpenSim pipeline 

## Path and Timeline to Learning
1. Meet just to go over Qualisys software (don't necessarily have to record) 
2. Meet to go over marker placement and all that
3. Then record a dataset with Aaron attempting to take the lead
