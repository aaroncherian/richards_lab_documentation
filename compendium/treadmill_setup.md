# Treadmill Setup

## Initial Setup
1. **Turn on the treadmill and unlock the clamps:**
    - The clamps stop the treadmill from moving up or down incline-wise.
    - Loosen the clamps slightly until about 2 threads are showing.
    - Hit the flashing enable button either at the treadmill or the computer to link the treadmill.

## Homing the Treadmill
1. Open the treadmill app from the toolbar (`Treadmill Control Panel 1.8.7`).
2. If there are errors, hit OK (errors may appear if you hit the e-stop last).
3. Close the app and reopen it.
4. Hold the blinking downward triangle to home the treadmill.
    - Once the slider appears, decline it until the display says 'Homed' instead of 'Jog Only.'
5. Tighten the clamps after homing.
